# Wallet scripts

Random scripts I used for fiddling with [Wallet](https://budgetbakers.com/) data.

## Usage

These are not by any means polished programs - you at the very least need to
read the code and change some constants before you run them.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# set your credentials in the .env file, and change whatever constants in the script

# install dependencies
gem install bundler
bundle install

# run the script at your own risk
bundle exec ruby the_script.rb
```
